# Data-Engineering | Visualization Amazon products
Python - MapReduce - Spark - MySQL - AWS

This project was the end result of the class Data Engineering (@University of Antwerp).
We needed to create a data pipeline to transform Â± 9 million rows of data
about orders on Amazon in order to gain usefull insights.
After transforming the data, a MySQL-database was created.
Thereafter, tools provided by AWS were used to visualize these insights.
